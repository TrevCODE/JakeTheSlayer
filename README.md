# JakeTheSlayer
Game Description:
The world has been consumed by zombies. Jake is a slayer, a person that keeps the zombie population at bay. Slayer's are given the antidote to prevent them from turning since they are in short supply. Jake has received intel that the zombies have figured out a way to create faster, stronger, and overall much more threatening versions of themselves in a chemicle lab on the other side of the province of Quebec. Jake needs to stop the zombies otherwise whatever human settlements that exist in Canada are in trouble. 

Scenerio and Character description:
Jake is black, stylish, always carries his sword and shotgun. There will be three main enemy types, they vary from weak and fast to strong and slower. There will be a boss at the end of each level. 

Character Actions and Goals:
Jake will have two main attacks. Melee with a sword that deals little damage but will push enemies (excluding bosses) back, and a shotgun that deals a good amount of damage at close range. Power ups for increased speed and strength will spawn at random points in the level, zombies can spit at Jake which might lead to decreased speed for a limited amount of time. The goal is to kill all the zombies and the bosses of each level.

Game win/lose Conditions:
If Jake is killed by zombies the player will have to restart the level. To win the game the player will have to complete all the levels and defeat the final boss

Progression of Levels:
Each level in the game will see an increase of difficulty. To do this the amount of zombies on screen will be increased and there will be more of a mixture of the three enemy types, also increase the chances of decreased speed when spat on.

Sources of Inspiration:
The main inspiration for this project is Super Metroid on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The platforming, and shooting in that game is second to none.

What Skills/Interests:
I am looking for a team that enjoys classic side scrolling titles that come from or are inspired by the classics like Super Metroid, Castlevania, etc. I am also looking for someone that can animate the sword attacks and shooting attacks.
